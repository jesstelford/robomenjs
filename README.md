## Aim

You have to get all the little RoboMen to the target.
May sound easy, but you have to solve a few puzzles first, using only what you're given.

You are in charge of two robots who must escape the levels on offer. Each robot will walk and walk until they hit an obstacle (wall, fence, rock, etc) upon which they turn. The red robot turns left every time, the blue robot turns right. You drop markers onto the area to guide them (arrows to force them to turn, etc) and need to get them home!

## Info

All Yellow RoboMen Will turn clock-wise when they walk into an obstacle.
All Red RoboMen will turn Anti-Clock-wise when they walk into an obstacle.

The Red arrows do as they suggest, and the circular ones rotate either Clockwise
or Anti-clockwise ( shown by the arrows on it ). The U-Turn symbol will reverse
the direction of any RoboMan when he walks on it.

## Instructions

Click + Drag available directional peices onto the game-field.
To re-claim a peice already placed, simply click it, and it will be put back
into your inventory.

When you're ready to try the level, Hit "GO!" on the Right.

If at any time you want to reset the level, hit "Reset" on the Left.

## Using the Editor

This is a bit of a confusing one :)

For starters, if you hold Control, the grid will go away.

Next, if you press the grave key "`" ( the one next to your number 1 key ), you will
be able to save what you have made.
If you Hold shift while pressing the grave key, you are able to open a pre-saved level.

Now, how do you place peices?
Well, you see that flashing cursor in the bottom section? Next to "Current Tile".
Well, type in a number ( any number ) Then press Enter ( not on the KeyPad ).

You will see a tile appear underneath the cursor for you to place on the game-board.

To place this peice, simply click.

Here is a list of the numbers;

```
1 = home square
2 = Rotate CW
3 = Rotate CCW
4 = Reverse Direction
5 = up arrow
6 = down arrow
7 = right arrow
8 = left arrow

10 = Avatar Type 1 - CW ( Yellow )
11 = Avatar Type 2 - CCW ( Red )

20 = normal terrain
21 = wall - horizontal
22 = wall - verticle
23 = wall - top-right corner
24 = wall - top-left corner
25 = wall - bottom-right corner
26 = wall - bottom-left corner
27 = rock
28 = water
29 = water - bottom
30 = water - top
31 = water - right
32 = water - left
33 = water - top-right corner
34 = water - top-left corner
35 = water - bottom-right corner
36 = water - bottom-left corner
37 = water - top-right inner corner
38 = water - top-left inner corner
39 = water - bottom-right inner corner
40 = water - bottom-left inner corner
```

There is a special condidion when placing an Avatar - Once he is placed, he needs
a starting direction. You cannot do anything else until you specify this.
So, click to place the Avatar, then use the directional keys to give him a Direction.
You wont see him change direction, but you will when the level is loaded into the game.

To change the values for the available Actions ( Up, Down, etc ), hit Tab until the
cursor comes to the one you want to change.
Simply change the value, and move on.
The same goes for setting the number of lives.

Have FUN!
